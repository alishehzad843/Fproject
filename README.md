**Introduction**
The aim of this project is to design and develop an online validation of studentâ€™s required documents for admission using the OCR technique. The main objective of our system is to eradicate all the hurdles faced by the students during admission verification. Students face real problems in manual procedures like lack of staff availability, time-consuming process as a lot of students are eligible for admissions, improper guidance, etc. In this regard, a system designed that converts the manual admission verification system to the online admission verification system. It helps in the verification of students after being eligible for admission on the merit list. Once it is online there is no need for manual verification of required documents. Students just have to log in to the system and upload his/her documents on the portal. The required documents verified in the system and then after the verification fee challans will be generated for them. The basic information of every student applied is placed in a database. When student uploads all their documents this system, using the OCR technique, will inspect the documents and find out the data required for verification. After finding, the system will compare the data with the record of the students whose name will be on the merit list. When the data which we get from the documents, and the record of the student whose name is on the merit list will be matched a system will generate a fee challan form for that student.
The main goal of the system is to automate the process carried out a result with improved performance and realized the vision of paperless admission and manual verification.
